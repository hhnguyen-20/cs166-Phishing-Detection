Datasets used:
CEAS_08.csv (training)
TREC_07.csv (testing)

Note: 
In case errors with NLTK are encountered, make sure NLTK resources are downloaded.
Try calling `nltk.download('stopwords')` and `nltk.download('wordnet')`. 
As a last resort, you can try `nltk.download('all')`, but this may be expensive.
