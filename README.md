# CS166-Phishing-Detection

## Project Introduction:

Welcome to our Email Phishing Detection project! This project utilizes machine learning techniques to classify emails as either spam or legitimate based on their content, specifically the email title and body text. By training models on labeled email data, we've developed a robust system capable of accurately discerning between phishing attempts and genuine communications.

## Getting Started:

To get started with our project, follow these simple steps to set up your development environment:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/email-phishing-detection.git
   cd email-phishing-detection
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   Create a new Python environment and install the required packages using pip:
   ```
   pip install flask pdfplumber beautifulsoup4 joblib pandas matplotlib numpy seaborn scikit-learn nltk
   ```

3. **Running the Full Stack App:**
   After setting up the environment, navigate to the 'support_vector_machine' directory and execute the 'app.py' file. Make sure to run all necessary Python files to build and save the model before running the app.

   ```
   cd support_vector_machine
   python app.py
   ```

With these simple steps, you'll be ready to explore our Email Phishing Detection project and harness its capabilities to identify phishing emails with ease. Happy coding!
